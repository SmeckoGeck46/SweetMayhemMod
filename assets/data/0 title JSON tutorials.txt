gfTitle.json stuff:
"animationType": what animation type it is (string)
so, let me explain this one:
	if you set it to "gfIdle", it plays like a regular gf idle animation
	if you set it to "bfIdle", it plays like a regular bf idle animation
	if you set it to "loopIdle", it plays like a regular bf idle animation, but looped
"curName": animation name of the little shit (string)
"useIndices": if "animationType" is set to "gfIdle", then this determines if you want the gf animation to play out with either
				a series of frames or not (bool)
"leftFrames": setup idea: [30, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] (float array, only if "useIndices" is true)
"rightFrames": setup idea: [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] (float array, only if "useIndices" is true)
"leftName": animation name of the left dance (string, only if "useIndices" is false)
"rightName": animation name of the right dance (string, only if "useIndices" is false)
"curX": the x offset (float)
"curY": the y offset (float)
"curFPS": the FPS of the animation (float)
"shouldScale": if it should scale the little shit (boolean)
"curScale": what to scale it by, only works if shouldScale is true (float, converted to int, rounded by 0)
"isPixel": if it should have anti-aliasing (bool)
	by the way, the values are flipped for isPixel
	so if you set it to true, it would turn off anti-aliasing
	if you set it to false, it would turn on anti-aliasing

"shouldWink": if there should be a wink animation
"winkName": what the wink animation's name is
"winkFPS": what the wink animation's framerate is

enterTitle.json stuff:
"idleName": idle animation name (string)
"pressName": press animation name (string)
"curX": the x offset (float)
"curY": the y offset (float)
"idleFPS": the FPS of the idle animation (float)
"pressFPS": the FPS of the press animation (float)
"idleLoop": if the idle animation should loop (boolean)
"pressLoop": if the press animation should loop (boolean)
"shouldScale": if it should scale the little shit (boolean)
"curScale": what to scale it by, only works if shouldScale is true (float, converted to int, rounded by 0)
"isPixel": if it should have anti-aliasing (bool)
	by the way, the values are flipped for isPixel
	so if you set it to true, it would turn off anti-aliasing
	if you set it to false, it would turn on anti-aliasing
