Hey there, how's it going? I made this update log so people can actually know what I add when I update Disappointing Plus.
Just a disclaimer, I only started making this after 1.3.0, so some of the updates before it may be wrong.

1.3.1

	- Module State has been updated since last update but is still very much a work in progress!
	- The song section is the most complete, and I would recommend only using that if you want to try it.
	- It will continue to be updated in later versions.

		- Example: char.singPriority.push('hey');
	- Psych UI's song position works better
	- Made mid song start (via charting state) reset after changing songs or re-entering charting state
	- This updateLog now builds :flushed:

[Bug Fixes]
