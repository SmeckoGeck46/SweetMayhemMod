HOW TO MAKE MASKED MAYHEM'S VOICE USING UTAU VOICEBANKS:

1) Make a track using the unmasked voicebank.
2) Make two tracks using the masked voicebank. One track should be the main octave, the other should be lowered by 1 octave.
3) Make the unmasked voicebank track -6 dB when editing in post.
4) Profit.

If you use OpenUtau, you can do all of this in one project. If you are using UTAU, which limits to only 1 voicebank track per file, then you'll have to either save 3 different UTAU projects or render every track through one project.

If you just want to make an UTAU voicebank using samples from the chromatic scale because you think this process is too complicated, be my guest.
